      It is a mouth watering traditional Gujarati snack prepared with gram flour and buttermilk and seasoned with sautéed sesame seeds and few other spices. It’s not only easy to make but healthy as well because it just involves steaming gram flour and buttermilk and does not require any other complex cooking techniques.

<p style="font-size:25px;">
    India has always loved its street food and any city you visit in the country will be lined with vendors selling local favorites. On the streets, you can find meals, desserts, and refreshing drinks like chai or fresh-squeezed juice. <br><br>

    Indian street food is often spicy, sometimes oily, and always delicious. It's also a great equalizer with people from all classes and economic backgrounds lining up at popular vendors.<br><br>
    
    Indian street food has a long history. On the streets of Delhi, you can visit kebab vendors who used to serve the Mughal kings. In Kolkata, you'll find fusion street food that was created with British customers in mind during colonial times.

      Manipuri cuisine refers to the cuisine of Manipur, a state of northeastern
      India. Daily meals are based on rice, with a few side dishes of
      vegetables, fish and meat.[1] A meal would usually have a vegetable stew
      called ensaang or athongba, flavored with dried or fried fish; stir-fried
      vegetables called kanghou; and a spicy item, which could be morok metpa (a
      chilli paste), iromba (boiled and mashed vegetables with chilli and
      fermented fish), or singju (a piquant salad). All piquant side dishes are
      accompanied by a choice of fresh herbs, collectively called maroi. The
      base and essence of Meitei cuisine is the fermented fish called ngari.
      Several dishes of meat, mostly chicken and pork,[2] are cooked with unique
      recipes.[3] A side of steamed (a-ngaanba) or boiled vegetables with a hint
      of sugar (cham-phut) are also quite common as palate cleansers in most
      meals. The aromatics of most dishes start with frying bay leaf, chives,
      onion, garlic, and ginger in mustard oil. The rest of the vegetables
      follow after that. Oil is sparingly used in most of the main stews but the
      sides of kanghou (stir-fried spicy vegetables) and bora (fritters) make up
      for that. Fish is also a staple, and appears in every meal, either as
      ngaari or as roasted or fried pieces. While fish is an essential part of
      the diet, due to increasing prices, fish curry is prepared only
      occasionally, or during feasts. The Meiteis live in the valley of Manipur
      where freshwater fish from lakes and rivers and ponds had been plentiful
      until recent times. While part of the cuisine has some influences from the
      cuisines of Southeast Asia, East Asia, Central Asia, Siberia, Micronesia,
      Polynesia as well as from Assam and West Bengal, the essence remains
      distinct from any other.

      Here is another favourite dish among the Manipuris. Their cuisine almost
      always includes a type of fish called Ngari. Eromba is prepared by boiling
      a tonne of vegetables along with some fermented fish. It is mixed until
      the texture becomes like a paste. Finally, it is garnished with maroi and
      a sprinkle of coriander leaves.

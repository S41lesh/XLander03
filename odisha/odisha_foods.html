<div style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;text-align: center;font-size: 40px;">Wadas are very popular throughout India. In Odisha, though, it is called Bara. The Bara is made using black dal or urad dal and is deep fried till the outer layer turns crisp. The best way to enjoy Bara is to drench it in a bowl of the sweet and spicy chutney that is normally served with the dish. You could also have it with ghugui, a spicy peas curry (much like the ragda) that is another very popular street food in Bhubaneswar.

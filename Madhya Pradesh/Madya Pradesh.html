        Daal Bafla that is fondly served in many parts of Madhya Pradesh has got its influence from Rajasthani cuisine. Dal Bafla is a mouth-watering cuisine which is very similar to the famous Dal Bati of Rajasthan. Bafla is a delicious treat of the wheat balls well cooked in ghee. The dish is well complemented with a bowl of Dal and coriander sauce (Hari chutney). Dal Bafla is not only celestial in taste but also provides a good dose of multiple vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates and fat just in the right quantity.

        Mughlai cuisine has had a deep impact on the food of Bhopal and one of the most prominent dishes that were born out of this is the Bhopali Gosht Korma. The dish is part of the something called the Nawabi cuisine and it’s made by slow cooking mutton chunks in a rich and spicy gravy. The result is a melt-in-the-mouth mutton dish that is fit of feasts of the very special kind. Bhopal’s narrow food market Chatori Gali is famous for its Nawabi delicacies and it’s where you should head, if you want a taste of this heavenly meat preparation.

    <p style="”color:#000;font: size 25px;;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;”">
        Bhopal is one of the best places to have biryani at in India. In Bhopali biryani, mutton is the main meat, but chicken also makes an appearance in some places. It’s one of the most loved regional variants of a dish that India has had a long and very historical love affair with. In Bhopal, it’s called the biryan or biryani pilaf or mutton pulav. It’s served with zarda, which is a traditional South Asian sweet dish, made by boiling rice with food coloring, milk and sugar, and flavored with cardamoms, raisins, saffron, pistachios or almonds.

    <p style="”color:#000;font: size 25px;;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;”">
        Vada pav is a vegetarian fast food dish native to the state of Maharashtra. The dish consists of a deep fried potato dumpling placed inside a bread bun (pav) sliced almost in half through the middle. It is generally accompanied with one or more chutneys and a green chili pepper. Although it originated as cheap street food in Mumbai, it is now served in food stalls and restaurants across India. It is also called Bombay burger in keeping with its origins and its resemblance in physical form to a burger.

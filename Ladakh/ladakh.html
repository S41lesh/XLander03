      Tingmo is a vegetarian dish that might be eaten at Breakfast, Lunch,
      Breakfast or Dinner (generally any time of the day) is one need to attempt
      food of Ladakh. It is nothing, yet generally, a flavorful vegetable stew
      that could be eaten both as a snack or a dish. The necessary active
      ingredients that enter into the making of the recipe are vegetables, and
      it is served together with fermented bread pieces. Though mainly it is a
      vegetarian meal, a non-vegetarian option of this might additionally be
      made.

      Khambir is traditional bread preferred by the locals of Leh Ladakh in the
      majority of their dishes. This bread is brownish in color with a thick
      crust baked in a pan. The bread is served with a butter tea which is
      prepared by adding a pinch of butter as well as salt. The unique taste of
      butter tea with a loaf of Khambir is the best thing you will ask for in
      Leh Ladakh.

      Another dumpling soup made similarly as the same way as the Chutagi but
      shaped like really tiny thumb-sized chapatis. The soup is tasty with the
      essence of all the various veggies that are taken into it. For a non- veg
      skew mutton is most preferred as well as potatoes are a should give it a
      nice flavor and texture.

      Khar (alkali) is synonymous with Assamese cuisine. Essentially, it is an
      exotic liquid strained from sun-dried banana skin and cooked with a
      seasonal vegetable like papaya(omita), water gourd (pani lau)or mustard
      greens (lai haak). However, due to the rare availability of banana skin
      khar, we may use baking soda as a substitute. Relished as a starter, one
      of the most popular and easy-to-cook khar dishes is prepared with papaya.
      The dish has health benefits and is considerably beneficial for digestion.
      The cooking method may vary from person to person; here’s my recipe for
      this simple yet delicious Assamese dish.

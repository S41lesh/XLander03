      Will you prepare Jadoh for us? We asked our host in Mawphlang. He gave a
      smile and asked if we wanted the one suitable for a tourist, or were we
      adventurous enough to try the traditional Jadoh of the Khasi tribe. In
      Khasi language, ‘Ja’ means rice and ‘Doh’ means meat. While most of the
      Khasi food involves some or the other form of meat, vegetables generally
      take a back seat and are only consumed as salads. Most of the tourists opt
      for the Jadoh that is cooked in pork fat itself. The locals also enjoy
      eating ‘Jadoh snam’ that is cooked in blood. Jadoh for a Khasi is like
      biryani for a North Indian, with rice cooked with meat. But the spices are
      very different and it does not use much of oil. Most recipes of Jadoh snam
      will talk about carefully choosing the type of blood as it can enhance or
      destroy the taste. However, our host told us that they can make it go with
      any blood that is available. Are you up for it? If yes, chuck the recipes
      on internet and travel to a village of Meghalaya to try the authentic
      Jadoh. It is generally eaten during morning by the locals during Khasi
      festivals. Pork or chicken blood is added while cooking adding a distinct
      metallic taste to the rice. By the way, we were weak hearted. So we opted
      for the Jadoh cooked in pork fat only without blood.

      A wholesome meal that is healthy at the same time – Doh Khlieh is a
      delicious salad made out of minced pork, onions, and chilies. If you are
      in the mood for some fusion food, some places dish up Doh-Khlieh with a
      Mexican touch by adding beans, tomatoes, carrots, and lemons. It is also
      sometimes cooked as a curry of pig brains and eaten with bread.

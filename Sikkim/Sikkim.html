      Sikkim tea is a variety of tea grown in the state of Sikkim, India. Though
      Sikkim tea is not as widespread in use as the neighboring Darjeeling tea,
      it has recently gained more recognition from the increasing demand for
      organic products.[1] The tea is mostly sold under the marketing name 'Temi
      tea'. After Darjeeling tea became the first Indian product to receive a GI
      tag, Sikkim's Temi tea has been waiting to receive the same.

      Kosha mangsho or mutton kosha is a very popular traditional dish in
      Bengal, and it’s translated as sautéed meat. The gravy is slow-cooked over
      low flame for a very long time to get a rich, dark-brown gravy and
      melt-in-the-mouth mutton (goat) pieces. This thick gravy made with the
      strong flavors of mutton is a favorite at every Bengali household. A
      little high on the spice quotient, this kosha mangsho recipe or Bengali
      style mutton curry can be had with traditional crisp Bengali luchi or with
      a portion of the delicious Bengali mishti pulao. This dish is
      traditionally made in an iron kadai which gives it a deep dark brown
      color. This Bengali mutton recipe is an instant hit at every Navratri and
      Poila Baisakh or the Bengali New Year celebrations. There is nothing like
      this sumptuous mutton curry to take you through the day. If you are
      visiting Kolkata, a trip to Shyam Baazar to taste the iconic Golbarir
      kosha mangsho is a must. It’s a tiny eatery but the flavor that the
      mangsho it serves is unmatchable.

      Luchi alur dom is the preferred Bengali combination for a lazy Sunday
      brunch. The dish has Luchi that is similar to puris and is eaten with alur
      dum or aloo dom, that is a spicier and more tangy version of the dum aloo.
      To grab a plate of some delectable luchi-alur dom, head to Fairlie Road in
      Kolkata, that is a popular haunt of the lovers of Bengali street food in
      the city. The road has a number of stalls that sell everything from rice
      and dish curry to kachuris (stuffed luchis).

    <p style="”color:#000;font-size:25px;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;”">
      You can call it the Bengali version of the bhel. Jhal Muri is another street food that Bengalis swear by. It’s made from rice flakes (muri) tossed with spicy chutney and mustard oil, along with roasted lentils and coconut chunks. It’s a convenient snack to munch on, while travelling around the city in the evening, and engaging in long-winding conversations with a friend. The absolute best place to sample the jhal muri is Dacre Lane or Dacre Street in Kolkata, that has been appreciated by the WHO that claimed that the food here was the Best Street Food in the World!

    <p style="”color:#000;font-size:25px;font-weight:normal;text-align:left;”">
      AThere’s no denying the fact that the various kinds of fish curries of Bengali cuisine are the absolute best. But if you get fed up of eating fish and want to try some other meat here, you must sample the daab chingri- jumbo prawns cooked in mustard and served in tender coconut. Oh! Calcutta is one of the restaurants in Kolkata known for the best Daab Chingri. Other things to try out at this restaurant are the nolen-gurer ice-cream and the bhapa sondesh.
